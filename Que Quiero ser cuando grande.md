 <b>When I grow up I want to be  Chemical Engineer. This is because Chemical engineers use knowledge of physics, chemistry and math all subjects that interest me and im good at. It also has a nice salary  of 110,000 to 180,000 that can afford for me to live. Chemical engineers solve problems that affect the use or production of chemicals, food, drugs and more. For now I know that a good place for a chemical engineer to work is pfizer since my mom used to work there.
